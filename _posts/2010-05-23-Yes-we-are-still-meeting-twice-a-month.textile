h2. Meeting Twice A Month

There was a lot of interest in the waco tech lunch meetings, originally, and we had close to 20 people cycle through the various meetings for the first few months. However, in the last month or so, the numbers have dwindled down to 2 or 3 people. I know I haven't been blogging here and haven't done such a great job of getting the word out, like I originally did... but I want to fix that and I need your help.
