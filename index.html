title: A Social Gathering Of Techies In Waco, TX
---

<h1>No More Tech Lunch</h1>
<p>
  Due to lack of interest from the community, other community events that happen on a regular basis, and no one showing up, the Waco Tech Lunch is no longer running. Be sure to check out the Waco Social Media Breakfast, though. You'll find plenty of interesting people to talk to and learn more about what is going on in Waco, there.
</p>

<h1>Welcome To Waco Tech Lunch!</h1>
<p>
	The Waco Tech Lunch is a monthly gathering of technical professionals and enthusiasts, for the sole purpose of socializing. Software developer, web developers, designer, IT support personal, and any other technology related personnel are all invited to come join the conversation. It's a great opportunity to meet new people, make new friends, and talk tech!

<h2>Who Should Go?</h2>
<p>If you're a technology professional or enthusiast in the Waco, TX area, you should definitely come! That includes software developers, web developers, designers, IT support persons, and any other technical trade related to computers, software and hardware. </p>

<h2> Why Should I Go?</h2>
<p>There's a small but growing number of techies in the Waco area. I (<a href="http://derickbailey.lostechies.com">Derick Bailey</a>) am one of them, and I don't know very many of you. I'd like to change that by having a monthly get together over lunch, so that we can talk about technology and Waco. If you're looking to talk tech, make some new friends, and generally have fun with your fellow techies, then you should come. </p>

<h2>When & Where Should I Go?</h2>
<p>The plan is to meet on the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/wacotechlunch%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics">2nd Wednesday of every month</a>, at Rudy's BBQ in Waco.</p>
